These are slides and a supplemental notebook presented to the [Boston Python](https://about.bostonpython.com)
user group on 26 May 2023 on the subject of the [`unicodedata`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html)
library in the Python Standard Library.

It's mostly an excuse to lay out a bit of context about what Unicode is and what
kinds of things it makes possible :)
