# Notes on Python modules for scientific computing

* [SciPy.org](http://www.scipy.org) is the main jumping-off point for information on any modules in the SciPy stack (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.)

* [Numba talk from SciPy 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzBi3xdEF2Y) demonstrating many features as well as pitfalls.  Includes some simple fluid dynamics as a toy problem.
