# Notes on Python modules for scientific computing

## Scipy

* [SciPy.org](http://www.scipy.org) is the main jumping-off point for information on any modules in the SciPy stack (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.)
* The [SciPy cookbook](http://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/) has great examples of digestible problems
* [Fitting data with scipy.optimize](http://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/FittingData.html)

## Numpy

* [Official numpy quickstart tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html), with lots of references to more detailed documentation
* [Notebook-based introduction to Python/numpy](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb) from a Stanford CS course
* [Numpy for MATLAB users](http://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users.html) - a side-by-side comparison of numpy and MATLAB
* [Broadcasting in numpy](http://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/EricsBroadcastingDoc) - breakdown of what actually happens with broadcasting

## Pandas

* [Some pandas notebooks in an IPython gallery](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks#pandas-for-data-analysis)
* [Pandas from the ground up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw) - a comprehensive introductory PyCon 2015 talk by Brandon Rhodes.  Supplemented by [exercise notebooks](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial)

## Astropy
  * [A 1-D model fit in Astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/modeling/#simple-1-d-model-fitting)
  * [Reading and plotting an image from a FITS file](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/io/plot_fits-image.html#sphx-glr-generated-examples-io-plot-fits-image-py)
  * [Real-world analysis from *"The kinematics of the Local Group in a cosmological context"*](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/forero/LG_Kinematics/blob/master/code/main_analysis.ipynb)
  * [Overview of Astropy and related libraries](https://github.com/adonath/gamma_astropy_talk/blob/master/gamma_astropy_talk.ipynb)

## Other misc information

* [Numba talk from SciPy 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzBi3xdEF2Y) demonstrating many features as well as pitfalls.  Includes some simple fluid dynamics as a toy problem
